# MediaAssignment
## implementation of Media
1. report.pdf is the report
2. implementation.ipynb is the implementation

      2.1we implemented an automatic test input generation for a img classifier for Mnist
  
      2.2we improved the optimization process by replacing gradient descent by evolutionary algorithms
  
      2.3The generation process will randomly mutate the seed img with random pixil values to generate new img that trigger the DL systems behave differently and maximize neuron coverage and minimize the #mutations
3. Generated results are in foler './results/'. There are 6079 generated results, 1735 for trial 1, 1330 for trial 2, 1568 for trial 3 and 1446 for trial 4 respectively.
